					# DESCRIPTION #
					###############
# Takes a FASTA file and determines if it is a sequence of nucleotides or amino
# acids.
#
	
					#########
					# USAGE #
					#########
# The user should pass a single argument, corresponding to the
# absolute or relative path where the FASTA file is.
#
#  EXAMPLE SYNTAX:  $./typeofSequence.sh /path/to/my/file.FASTA
#


					###################
					# EXECUTABLE CODE #
					###################
# Check if user passed exactly one argument:
numArgs=$#
if [[ numArgs -ne 1  ]]
then
	# Throw error message to stderr and exit with status 1:
	echo "ERROR: a single file name required, but $numArgs were passed." >&2
	exit 1
fi

# Get sequence line:
sequence=$(sed -n '2p' $1)

# Check if $sequence contains any character other than [ATCGUNatcgun] 
if [[ $sequence =~ [^ATCGUNatcgun] ]]
then	# If so, then it must be a sequence of amino acids
	echo ""
	echo "       âŒ¬  It is a sequence of amino acids âŒ¬"
else	# Otherwise, it must be a sequence of nucleotides
	echo ""
	echo "        ðŸ§¬ It is a sequence of nucleotides ðŸ§¬"
fi
